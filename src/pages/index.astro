Hey, I'm Cam, a front-end designer and developer of over 7 years.

While I loved working on the UI, animations, and interactivity of web apps, I'd always felt held back by not knowing how to
create full-stack web apps.

I knew how to work with API's and someone else's database, but I'd never learned how to build my own until...

_A wild [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/) enters the chat!_

Creating a database table was as easy as:

\`\`\`javascript
import { defineTable } from "astro:db";

const Posts = defineTable({
  columns: {
    id: column.number({ primaryKey: true }),
    title: column.text(),
    pubDate: column.date(),
    description: column.text(),
    author: column.text(),
    imageUrl: column.text({ optional: true }),
    imageAlt: column.text({ optional: true }),
    tags: column.json({ optional: true }),
    slug: column.text({ unique: true }),
    content: column.text()
  }
});
\`\`\`

And, getting all the posts from the database was as easy as:

\`\`\`javascript
import { db, Posts } from "astro:db";

const posts = await db.select().from(Posts).all();
\`\`\`

I found myself building full-stack web apps without really having to think too much about databases. They just worked.

Writing code felt freeing and fun again.

I got this spark and reinvoration to code again after the hardest season of my life, when I was bed-ridden for around seven months. [God](https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-the-gospel.html) sustained me through
the support of friends and family. He healed me spiritually before physically restoring my health.

After recovering, I finally felt freedom.

My hope is that Freedom Stack empowers you to create the dreams and visions on your mind and heart.
